# broken remote

Unused assets for a [pigsquad](http://pigsquad.com/) game jam.

## getting started

To start the game, you need a local web server!

Just can run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` in the root of this folder (or whatever other method you prefer for getting a server started locally).

After that, you can just go to http://localhost:8000 and it should be viewable there!

## project structure

The main game files are in the `public` folder.

The `game.js` file contains all of the game logic.

Inside of there are `assets`, split into `sprites` and `backgrounds`.
